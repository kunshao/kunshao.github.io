I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft. My professional interests are in distributed systems and cloud computing. 

I graduated from University of Michigan in December 2014 with B.S.E in Computer Science and B.S in Economics. 

Outside of work, I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29685054-kun-shao), [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14279105), skiing,  cooking, and playing the keyboard (very amaturely). 

Feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunshao/), or check out my corners of the internet below.
